🎓 What is an A-Level?
A-Levels (Advanced Levels) are subject-based qualifications that can lead to university, further study, training, or work. Students usually take 3 or 4 A-Levels over 2 years (Year 12 & 13).

📚 What is an EPQ?
The EPQ (Extended Project Qualification) is a research-based project worth half an A-Level. It allows students to explore a topic they are passionate about. It helps with university applications, teaches independent learning, and is valued by top universities.

🔧 What is a BTEC?
BTECs are vocational qualifications that focus on practical, real-world skills. They are coursework-based and suitable for students who prefer applied learning. Some students take one BTEC alongside A-Levels.
